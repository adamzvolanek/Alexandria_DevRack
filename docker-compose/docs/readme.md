# docs

Comprised of documentation stacks:

- [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)
- [Memos](https://www.usememos.com/)
- [WikiJS](https://js.wiki/)

Currently I am using WikiJS for my own documentation website however now testing BookStack as well.

[Paperless-Ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) exists as an internal documentation tool.
